# T2TRG work meeting on Digital Twins

“Digital Twins” has become an increasingly popular concept in the context of IoT systems. Like “IoT”, the term has many definitions across industries and academia, but usually Digital Twins refer to digital representations that are counterparts of entities and processes in the physical world, and that are being synchronized with those physical entities. This synchronization often involves sensing the state of physical objects and changing their state -- a task that most IoT systems are designed to perform.

IETF has specified many key communication technology standards for IoT, including (adaptations of) the Internet Protocol, set of transport and transfer protocols suitable for various environments, security mechanisms, application data formats, and data models.

In this work meeting we plan to explore the state of applicability of IETF technologies in building Digital Twins, with a view to identifying gaps for further standardization development at the IETF and research opportunities at the IRTF. We invite researchers and practitioners working on IoT and/or Digital Twins to present and discuss.
